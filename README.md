# CoinsValuesCalculator

Calculate the summary value of your coins using the prices returned by [CoinMarketCap.com], and [CryptoCompare.com]. 
The coins' balances could be entered using Balances.html and could be saved in Firebase.

## Create fb.js file in the following format

```javascript
function getFbCredentials () { 
    return [
        '', //firebase username
        ''  //firebase password
    ]
}
```

## Open CoinsValuesCalculator.html in browser
Tested in Chromium/Chrome only, should also work in Firefox.
